title:  After Merging Changes on GitHub, Sync Them to Your Local Branch

After merging changes to main on GitHub, here's how to sync them to your local main branch:

```bash
# Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch
git pull origin main
```

That's it! The `git pull` command fetches the changes from GitHub and merges them into your local main branch.

**Alternative approach (more explicit):**
```bash
git checkout main
git fetch origin      # Download changes without merging
git merge origin/main # Merge the changes into local main
```

**Common workflow:**
If you were working on a feature branch and merged it via a GitHub pull request, you'd typically do:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature-branch-name  # Delete your local feature branch (optional)
```

**Quick tip:** If you want to update main while staying on your current branch:
```bash
git fetch origin main:main
```

This updates your local main branch without having to switch to it first.
