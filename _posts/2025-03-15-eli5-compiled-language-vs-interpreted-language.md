Compiled languages are **faster** but need a prep step (compiling), while interpreted ones are **easier to change** but can be slower.

- *Compiled Language*: It's like writing down the full recipe in a neat cookbook **before** anyone starts cooking. Once it's written, the chef (computer) can follow it quickly without stopping to ask questions. Example: C, C++.  

- *Interpreted Language*: It's like a friend reading the recipe to you **step by step** while you cook. If they make a mistake or forget an ingredient, you find out **while cooking**, not before. Example: Python, JavaScript.
